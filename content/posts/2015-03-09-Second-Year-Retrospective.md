Title: (Almost) Two Years as a Software Developer
Tags: thoughts
About: A retrospective.
Status: draft

In a few months I will be coming up on my two year anniversary of becoming a
Professional Software Developerâ„¢. I wanted to take some time to reflect, and
write down what I think I've learned, and what I think I need to learn.

# What I've Learned

- Things do/can not move as fast as you want them to

We all want to improve things, but it takes wisdom to see the actual steps
needed to implement those improvements and realize the potential pitfalls
that are there.

For example, last year I began to dive into Docker -- a freaking sweet way
to do devops. Shortly after using Docker for a while I was convinced that my
company absolutely needed to Dockerize all the things. Now, this may be true,
but what I hadn't considered was all the pieces that needed to fall into place
for containerization to even be considered.

It reminds me of the time I went bouldering. You cannot just start climbing
and expect to finish the route. You need to mentally picture the steps
required because if you don't you may find you have expended 80% of your
energy on the first three grips whilst there are seven more to go. If you
carefully, patiently, and wisely plan your route, you can ensure you have the
energy to go on and reach your goal.

Same with software. Refactoring can be tempting, but it is possible to
refactor yourself into more of a mess than you had before.

# What I Need to Work On

- Patience

As I wrote above, things cannot move as fast as you want them to.
Being patient and waiting for the right moment can make all the difference.
Being prepared, keeping your finger on the "technology pulse", and knowing
the real problems that exist seem like the best strategy. This way, once
something becomes a priority you are ready to strike with your idea, and you
have a better chance of getting some real support.

- Convincing people with words

Despite my inexperience, I still firmly believe I have good ideas. Getting
people to understand my ideas so I can get support and advice has been
really difficult. Many times I find I am trying to explain an idea to go from
step A to step B, but to the listener, I am going from A to Z and they are
stuck trying to understand step B.

Maybe it's a generational thing, but I think that is just an excuse that I
refuse to use.
