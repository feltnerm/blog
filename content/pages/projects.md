title: projects

This is just a short summary of some of my favorite projects that I am working
on or have worked on. Most of what I work on is open-source and MIT
licensed which means you can do pretty much anything you want. I would love
feedback either via [email](mailto:mark+blog@feltner.me) or issues on the
project's respective issue tracker.
