</span>

My name is Mark Feltner. I have a passion for writing good software.
Particularly, in the domain of web development, but also in plenty of other areas.
By day, I am a software developer for [Widen Enterprises](http://widen.com) in [Madison, Wisconsin, USA](https://www.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=madison,+wi). By night, I
obsess over meaningless details on side projects, and even sometimes publish
them on [the internet](https://github.com/feltnerm). I also like to do other
things too.


If you have an interesting project you think I'd be a good fit for, feel free
to contact me.
