&lt;p&gt;Why write a static blog generator?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First and foremost, writing more. I want to do it. Becoming a better writer involves writing more, and having a blog is a great place to let out thoughts. I'd also like to have a permanent record of what I write, even if it's backed up on some cloud-server somewhere in the ether-verse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I'm going to be writing more I would like to have ownership over what I write. I'm not saying this is common or going to happen to me, but I wouldn't want something I wrote to be used commercially without at least my consent, and I certainly wouldn't want someone attributing something &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; wrote to themselves. Not cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, I'm very ok with transparency in my writing process to the extent of open-sourcing &lt;a href="https://github.com/feltnerm/blog"&gt;the generator&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://github.com/feltnerm/blog"&gt;the posts&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to submit an &lt;a href="https://github.com/feltnerm/blog/issues"&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt; if anyone finds a spelling error or any other bug :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I love to build things and tinker with software. I've already spent more time building and fine-tuning the programmatic aspects of this blog than I have actually writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing, to me, is simply thinking through my fingers.
